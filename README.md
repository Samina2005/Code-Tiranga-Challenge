The ACM Student Chapter of XIM organized an online event on the occasion of the 79th Independence Day (15th August 2025). The challenge, titled The Code Tiranga Challenge, invited participants to design a mini Independence Day-themed webpage that was interactive, animated, and visually patriotic. This tested their skills in HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript, along with creativity and design sense.
